Throughout time, people always come across the following question: how should we live in society? From the small cabin to the big city, our environment is constantly evolving in an attempt to find answers to new challenges and opportunities.

The project "Tiny Houses meet global Challenges" in Bauhaus Campus Berlin is a case study and confirmation of how it's crucial to rethink architecture in order to design the landscape of tomorrow.

„Are there alternatives to container villages? How do we shape neighborhoods in an immigration society? How do we have to work, learn and teach to master the great challenges of the future?“ - Bauhaus Campus Berlin

This is where our next Meetup will take place. On Monday the 08.01.2018 at 15:00, we’ll have the opportunity to participate on a guided tour, get to know the concept and see the Tiny Houses on site. Are you interested in housing architecture and exploring news ways of living? Then come along!
