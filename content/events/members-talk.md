Dear BAN Members,

do you have a project, a blog or even a life experience about architecture that you would like to share?

Along our path as architects, we create visions, change landscapes, mirror the spirit of times... One could say that behind every building or the smallest detail there’s a story to tell.

Perhaps you’ve been abroad, want to write a book or talk about your latest Revit script? On our second Meetup of the series „BAN Talks“ the time has come to stand up and share your own story!

Whether if you‘re a good listener or a charismatic storyteller, you‘re all invited to come. Let us show the world that architecture is not dead. On the contrary, it’s well alive and ready to speak out! ;-)

If you feel like giving a talk, let us know in the comments below which topic you'd like to present, so that we can get organized.

Looking forward!
