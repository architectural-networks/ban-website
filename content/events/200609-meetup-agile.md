Have you ever heard of **Agile Management**?

Agile practices have been known to the tech world for a long time now. Several frameworks such as Scrum, Kanban, or XP have been developed in order to manage the workflow of complex software projects.

Late in the '90s software development was becoming, due to its increasing complexity, more and more difficult to manage. Projects were out of budget, out of schedule, and ultimately lacking to respond to the client's demands.

Does this ring a bell, fellow architects?

In 2001, the release of the [Agile Manifesto](https://agilemanifesto.org/ 'Agile Manifesto') transformed the project management world.

Agile methodology is a process that helps teams provide quick and unpredictable responses to the feedback they receive on their project, while still delivering value to their clients. Scrum, probably the most popular agile framework, uses a prescribed set of roles, meetings, and artifacts and divides a large amount of work into periods of time called sprint cycles.

What if we applied these principles to architecture projects?

We invited [Martin Raasch](https://www.linkedin.com/in/martin-raasch-51310415/) to help us answer this and other questions.

Martin is a Free Range IT Project Manager with a background in Social Sciences and Liberal Arts. He is a fervent advocate of Agile Project Management that he has successfully applied to industries as diverse as architecture, manufacturing, transportation infrastructure, event management, and finance.

Together with his Scrum Team, he is solving problems by developing software around people's challenges and deploying it in their organizations.

Martin will share his experience with Scrum, including a case study where he spent three months within an architecture office in Berlin to help them implement Scrum as their project management system.

In order to work more efficiently and do fewer extra hours, we've also been experimenting with agile methodology on our own projects for some time now.

Come along if you're interested to know more about it.

We can assure you, it will change forever the way you approach your daily workflow!
