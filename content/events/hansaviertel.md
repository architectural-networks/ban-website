In our first ever BAN Walks event, we'll go to Hansaviertel. It is a social housing experiment from the 60s located in on the edge of Tiergarten in former West Berlin. Our improvised guide Daniel will guide us among buildings from Alvar Aalto, Oscar Niemeyer, Le Corbusier, Walter Gropius, and many other master architects.

And bring your cameras! This will also be a Photo Walk, and any photo sent to us will be published on the group page.

It's time to get your Bresson out to explore great modernist architecture!
