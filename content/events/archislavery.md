We all know that our profession can be quite hard sometimes. From grueling all-nighter at school, through cancelled weekends during our unpaid internships, to postpone vacations in our 60-hour senior level position; it is hard to find an architect who was never a victim of “archislavery”. The term came, is currently in the spotlight, recently in the architecture media, with some architects claiming it “a good tradition”, while others were asking for a ban of the practice.

What about you? Have you ever worked for free? Did you ever felt victim of archislavery?

But, most important, was it worth it? Do you think it is a justified practice?

Let’s meet up and talk about it in our next BAN Meeting!
