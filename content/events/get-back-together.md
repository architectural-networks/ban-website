It's time to get back together! On June the 30th we would like to gather a small group in a safe event environment. We will meet outdoors in a Biergarten and mantain the required 1.5m distance between everyone so that you can feel safe and comfortable.  
  
Furthermore, by hosting a safe event over the next 14 days, Meetup will make a donation to Global Giving's Coronavirus Relief Fund.  
  
Come along if youâ€™re looking forward to meet other architects in Berlin and help this cause.  
  
Hope you're all doing well.  
Looking forward to see you in person again!
