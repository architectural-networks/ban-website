Did you ever got through the experience of searching for an apartment in Berlin?

There was a time when Berlin had to promote itself as a city to attract people and assure its own growth. One way of achieving that was to define its own identity around the idea of youth, fun and space for creative freedom. Nowadays, Berlin is facing new challenges. World events such as economy crisis and wars led people to migrate and concentrate particularly on cities. On the other hand, you've certainly heard of the airbnb effect connected with massive tourism or saw protest against gentrification on the news. All these society themes have impact on our environment. They set the terms of our time and frame the context upon which architects are about to design.

Having said that, one of the hottest topics on the current architectural scene, is "Housing Architecture". The demand on urban areas is very high, which immediately leads to the question: how should we live in the future?

Our next meetup will take place at a very special venue, the Kontist Headquarters in Torstra√üe 177. We will brainstorm around the following topics: how to deal with existing/new buildings, city identity, affordability, inclusion, collective versus individual living... Furthermore, we'll also have as a guest Oliver Pritzkow the spokesman of the Tiny House Project at the Bauhaus Campus Berlin, bringing his own experience and knowledge to our session.

If you're into exploring and getting to know new concepts on housing architecture, come along! You're most welcome to share your ideas or projects that inspire you. Let's take this opportunity to brainstorm together and hopefully develop more awareness around this exciting architecture field!
