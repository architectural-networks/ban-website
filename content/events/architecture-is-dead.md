Have you ever thought of sharing your project or an idea about architecture through a Meetup session?

As architects one could say that things are changing around us. Thereâ€˜s a lot going on from drawing to bim modelling, big data, scripting, 3D printing, virtual reality, social platforms...

Architects should get together again and develop new business models. Based on this current evolution, we should be thinking about methods on how to optimize our tasks. Yet, how exactly?

On our upcoming Meetup, you are all invited to network again. Meet other architects and through an open debate discuss on how we imagine the future of our profession.

Please feel free as well to take advantage of this Platform by making it more meaningful and useful for our group. For instance: you want to make a Meetup about a specific subject, make a job advertisement, inform others of upcoming architecture events, in order to do this the only thing you have to do is to POST! ;-)

Looking forward to meetup again!
