On our next Meetup Session, you’re all invited to build an architectural vision board.

Vision boards are tools that allow people to visualize their dreams and set their goals for the future.

What do we, as architects, want to achieve in the next 100 years?

In order to formulate an idealised vision of the architectural future, we first need to identify our wishes and desires. On our vision board, these will be arranged according to the following 5 sectors: Construction, Technology, Marketing, Workplace and Design.

**1. Construction**  
How do we want buildings be built in the future?  
3D Printing, new Materials, Construction Site Live Scanning

**2. Technology**  
Can we use technology to our profit?  
BIM, Programming, Generative Design

**3. Marketing**  
How should architecture be merchandised and presented?  
As Art, as a Brand? AR VR Playrooms

**4. Workplace**  
What should be the ideal office strategy?  
Business models, mobile workplace, fair salaries

**5. Design**  
How will buildings aesthetically look like in 100 years?  
responsive components, algorithmic architecture

The next step will consist of collecting visualisation mediums such as photographs, sentences, quotes or drawings that mirror our architectural ambitions. The sources are up to us, it could be Pinterest, Websites, Magazines, Books, Music, Objects...

You can participate by uploading your visualisation medium - named after “sector_name.jpg” - directly to our meetup web page under photo album "Vision Board". Short before the meetup date, we’ll put all the images together according to each sector and post a preview of the board.

An architectural vision board acts as powerful motivator to enact on achieving our goals and to be more conscious about the direction that we want to pursue as architects on a long term future. This will be the starting point of our architectural debate.

Join us on upcoming Meetup Session to share your own experience or ideas about the future of the architecture world! :-)
