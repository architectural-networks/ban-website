As some of you may already know our next Meetup will be all about... Networking!

On the last Brainstorming Session our group consisted of a cartographer, a painter, a graphic designer, a journalist and a couple of architects. A very rich dialog with different perspectives took place here.

So, if you're looking forward to meet other members, get to know what they’re doing at the moment and exchange ideas on diverse creative fields, this is the chance!

We will get together on Friday 16.03 in Fahimi Bar, Skalitzer Str. 133 at 19h30.

Come along and take this opportunity to enjoy yourself while expanding your network!
