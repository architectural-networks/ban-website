Dear BAN Members,

for the kick off of our brand new BAN Kino series, we're going to watch a film about one of the greatest challenges of our time. Here's the synopsis:

"Housing prices are skyrocketing in cities around the world. Incomes are not. PUSH sheds light on a new kind of faceless landlord, our increasingly unliveable cities and an escalating crisis that has an effect on us all. This is not gentrification, it’s a different kind of monster. The film follows Leilani Farha, the UN Special Rapporteur on Adequate Housing, as she’s travelling the globe, trying to understand who’s being pushed out of the city and why."

“I believe there’s a huge difference between housing as a commodity and gold as a commodity. Gold is not a human right, housing is,” – Leilani Farha.

Come along if you want to get a better understanding and insight about this crisis affecting our cities world wide. We'll watch the film together and start a small discussion afterwards. Looking forward!
