This meetup is for everyone who is interested in Architecture. It's an opportunity to network and exchange ideas, stories or experiences...!

On our first Meetup we will be gathering on the 2nd of December at 16:00 in Companion Coffee, Oranienstr. 24. In this creative environment, we will get together and introduce ourselves. Everyone is invited to bring an image of one of their favorite architectural projects. We'll then discuss our choices and exchange ideas!
