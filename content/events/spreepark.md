Dear BAN-Members,

on our upcoming meetup we will have the oportunity to visit the "Spreepark" in Berlin. This is an oficial open-day event, so there are going to be discussions about future visions, performances as well as workshops for free.

The Spreepark was once a very popular East Germany amusement park and has been, since November 2001, abandoned to it's own fate. It's history is surrounded by tragic and controversial events, as you can read on the links below:

Feel free to bring your camera as well as your sketchbook in case you want to register the spooky atmosphere of this lost location in Berlin.

Looking forward to see you on our next BAN Walk!
